We're bringing back [barelyhuman.dev](https://barelyhuman.dev) this time it's going to be a lot more tech focused and we'll go through different tech that's available for you to work with. 

It's not easy to stay updated with what's going around the tech industry so this is a tiny attempt to help people.
