## Work

### [TillWhen](https://tillwhen.barelyhuman.dev/)

A simple timetracker for project based time logging, this was my first experiment as an indie developer to test if the market would accept such simplistic tools. Much to my surprise it has had a few active users for the past year

### [Taco (WIP)](https://taco.barelyhuman.dev/)

A project management and time logging tool built into one, the idea is too keep task management as simple as possible while also being able to collaborate with the team you are working with.
