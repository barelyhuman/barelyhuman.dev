Hey humans!

Let's get started with things I was able to complete the past weekend.

### Projects I helped with

- Numix - moved Numix projects test engine to Github Actions

## My Projects I was working on

### Taco

- Recorded a new demo video for it
- Made minor fixes and ui updates to the app
- Added command pallete to the app so you can now use keyboard shortcuts on the app.

### Hen

- Hen was down for a few hours due to a package version issue, got that fixed

### TWUI

TillWhen has not been updated for about 11 months now and one major thing that I wanted to do before I let it run on it's self is fix the UI consistency of the app and so I started working on https://twui.barelyhuman.dev/ which is basically just boiler plate ui elements right now and not themed for tillwhen but will be something I will keep trying to find time for.
