This weekend was a busy one since I spent quite a few hours working on [wrap](/devlogs/wrap-log-1.html)

While this was supposed to be added to base alpha version , I wasn't able to add it and so I did do this weekend, so now you have your projects listed on the tasks screen as well and you can select which project to focus on.

Basically you get to see what tasks you have are from which project, this is needed since the next week holds the addition of Teams and Member invites and then I'll be adding the assigning tasks to team/team members and that'll need this segregation to be in place so the user doesn't see a list of 1000 tasks when he only wants to see tasks from one project.
