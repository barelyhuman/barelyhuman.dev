Previously I mentioned I'd be travelling the weekends and so the amount of work on my own projects was close to nothing, fortunately this week there's no external factors that'd spoil my weekend so I'll be working both days.

There still was a few things that I accomplished in those few hours.

## Taco

- Added tests and magic link sign in on the alpha instance, you can now test the magic link demo using `demo@reaper.im` as the email. The implementation was quick since I had enough reusable code from TillWhen.
- Additionally, we also made a few visual additions to the task's list, namely the reduced opacity of completed tasks.

## react-native-zustand-repack

- Made a minor fix for the ignored files which are needed for the template, this is now pretty stable and I might move it to v1.0.0, the only thing I need to add is svg support
